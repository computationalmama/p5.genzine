# Why Is It Created?

> A significant part of my inspiration for creative coding 
stems from the frustration I faced in traditional computer science education. 

## Fustration in Traditional Education

When I first started learning to code, I was excited about its potential to connect people and make a positive impact on the world. I believed that coding was a powerful tool that could foster creative problem-solving and bring people together. However, my experience with traditional computer science courses left me feeling frustrated and uninspired.

These courses were primarily focused on learning programming languages like [C or C++](https://cplusplus.com/), but they failed to teach us how to create projects that could engage and connect people. Instead, we were asked to develop mundane programs such as bank account systems. While these systems could be technically challenging, they lacked the creativity and imagination I sought.

I vividly remember wanting to use code to build projects that would bring people together and create a sense of community. I felt trapped in a rigid system that left no room for creative expression. Although I desired to use technology for social change, the curriculum wasn't designed to accommodate such thinking. When I expressed my concerns to my professors, I was told that this was simply how the coding world operated and that if I couldn't handle the basics, I wasn't suited for more creative applications of code.

## Creative Coding and p5.js

Fortunately, my passion for using code to build connections persisted. I embarked on a journey of self-discovery and exploration, searching for new avenues in creative coding. That's when I discovered [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a web-based version of the Processing platform created by Lauren McCarthy in 2014. This accessible and adaptive JavaScript library aimed to make creative coding more approachable for artists, designers, educators, and beginners like myself.

With p5.js, I began experimenting and soon found myself immersed in the world of creative coding. I created interactive art installations, web animations, and other exciting projects that were not only technically challenging but also allowed me to explore my creativity and bring my ideas to life.

I was fortunate to study p5.js formally when I joined Parsons School of Design for my [MFA Design and Technology](https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/). Under the mentorship of Professor [Xin Xin](https://xin-xin.info/info/), I acquired the knowledge and skills to further explore creative coding and its potential for fostering connections and community. I want to thank them for always being supportive in my thesis process and everything else too.

Now, I'm writing to share my learnings with others interested in embarking on their own coding connectivity journey. 

My goal is to help others avoid the frustration and disillusionment I experienced in traditional computer science education and provide them with a roadmap for exploring the creative possibilities of code. I believe that code can be a powerful tool for building self-identity, connectivity, and community, and I hope this work inspires others to delve into the exciting world of creative coding.
