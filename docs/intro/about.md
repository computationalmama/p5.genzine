## Next Step

Some of the functions we are thinking of adding includes
- an `all` namespacing function, etc. `all.pageNumbers()`
- more typography functions, etc. `columns()`, `border()`, `gutter()`
- a more accessible way of rendering the canvas
- save `styles()`, a hierarchy-based way of writing code, etc. `h1, h2`
- add more helper functions, etc.`setFillStroke()`
- making it mobile friendly (currently jsPDF doesn't support mobile download)
- different way to flip through the zine
- more detailed printSettings: `paper`, `borderline`, `highres`, `mp4 export`
