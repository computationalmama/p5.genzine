# [p5.genzine](https://munusshih.github.io/p5.genzine/)

p5.(gen)Zine is a free and friendly library created by [Munus Shih](https://munusshih.com) and [Iley Cao](https://www.ileycao.com/) for anyone curious about creative code and zine-making. It utilizes the p5.js library to experiment with collaborative zine-coding, forking, remixing and explore what generative coded zine can do to contribute to community building.

See the [Quick start](intro/quickstart.md) guide for more details.

**CURRENT STATUS**: `v1.2` is in beta. Please feel free to send issues or pull request us!

## Documentation / Tutorials
- You can play with [this interactive documentation]() in OpenProcessing (not finished!)
- You can find the recording of a workshop we taught at 2022's Virtual Creative Coding Festival [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAQc3Ij3O8k&ab_channel=ProcessingFoundation).

## Next Step

Some of the functions we are thinking of adding includes
- an `all` namespacing function, etc. `all.pageNumbers()`
- more typography functions, etc. `columns()`, `border()`, `gutter()`
- a more accessible way of rendering the canvas
- save `styles()`, a hierarchy-based way of writing code, etc. `h1, h2`
- add more helper functions, etc.`setFillStroke()`
- making it mobile friendly (currently jsPDF doesn't support mobile download)
- different way to flip through the zine
- more detailed printSettings: `paper`, `borderline`, `highres`, `mp4 export`


## You Can Help ❤️

- By making a zine out of this and we can link them here :)
- Use them in your class, workshops or just simply sharing!
- Think of creative ways of using this library!
- Write tutorial/documentation on ur exp using this library
- issues or pull request us on how to enhance/fix the code
